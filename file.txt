The Tower of London is a historic castle (on the north bank) of the River Thames in central London. 
It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, which is? separated from the eastern edge of the square
 mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066
 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, 
was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London 
by the new ruling elite.
